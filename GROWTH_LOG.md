### 2026-10-01 - Public page render-quality repair

- Task: Repair the homepage and inner pages so the first screen carries a positioning line, key facts and priority entry points, and so authoring-pipeline artifacts never reach a public page.
- Defects found: markdown_in_quick_answer, body_in_quick_answer, raw_markdown_module, duplicated_quick_answer, internal_production_note, research_metadata_in_public (147 finding(s)) across 16 page(s).
- Files changed: `src/data/pages/*.ts` and `src/data/faq.ts` (fold and module data), `src/components/content/ModuleRenderer.tsx` (prose body now renders Markdown), `src/components/pages/ContentPage.tsx` (Quick Answer renders inline Markdown), `src/lib/markdown.tsx` (new minimal Markdown-to-React renderer, including tables), `src/styles/modules.css` (prose body and table rules), `scripts/validate-render-integrity.ts` (new regression), `package.json` (new `validate:render` step in the `verify` chain).
- URLs affected: None. Titles, H1s, canonicals, CTAs, page types and internal-link roles are unchanged, so `CONTENT_INDEX.md` is not revised.
- SEO/GEO changed: FAQ entries that previously existed only as a Markdown module are now real entries in `src/data/faq.ts` and render through the accessible FAQ block, so FAQPage schema coverage is no longer limited to the pre-existing entries. `hero.subtitle` is now a positioning line and `quickAnswer` is the concise answer, so the fold is a summary rather than a duplicate of the article.
- Copy changed: Reader copy no longer refers to the build-now brief, the game-check brief, the research cut-off date or the source-tier labels. Game facts, URLs, keyword intent, ad units and analytics are unchanged.
- Verification: `npm run verify` (typecheck, lint, template, content, render integrity, IndexNow tests, static export, rendered SEO) passes; a full-text scan of every exported page finds no raw heading markers, raw Markdown links, tables or bold markers, pipeline headings, research metadata or literal question/answer labels; a content-conservation check against the previous commit confirms no reader copy, page identity or SEO field was lost.
